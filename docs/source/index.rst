The WikiRevParser
=================

The **WikiRevParser** is a Python library that makes it easy to access and analyse revision histories of Wikipedia pages.

The WikiRevParser takes away the hastle of preprocessing the noisy revision histories, so you can focus on doing great research on temporal changes to Wikipedia pages. 

You can use the library for researching information structures, sentiment developments of a topic over time, text and image narratives in different languages, contributor networks, vandalism and much, much more.

Check out the detailed :ref:`documentation` or get started below.
