Examples
========

As a toy example we want to extract and analyse the development of the size of the content about `Vikings <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikings>`_ in three Scandinavian language versions: Danish, Norwegian and Swedish. 

To do this, we extract the revision histories from the three pages using our `Wikipedia API wrapper <https://github.com/ajoer/Wikipedia>`_, parse the output using the `WikiRevParser <https://github.com/ajoer/Wik>`_ and visualize the data.

Try it out, and if you run into issues, check out the `FAQ or file a bug <https://github.com/ajoer/WikiRevParser/issues>`_!
